IPython extension to run code remotely and return some results

This extension provides line and cell
[magics](http://ipython.readthedocs.org/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) to
run code on other python kernels, and return requested variables.  These
kernels can be remote kernels (probably best set up with
[`remote_ikernel`](https://bitbucket.org/tdaff/remote_ikernel/)), providing a
simple way to run code on one or more remote systems from a local IPython
instance.

The `remote_ikernel` module is very useful for seamlessly running Jupyter
notebooks on a local computer, but connecting to a remote system to actually do
the calculations.  However, in some cases, it's useful to be able to run most
of the calculations on the local computer, but get quick results from remote
systems when transferring all the data needed for the calculation would take
too long, or when results from several remote systems need to be combined into
one analysis.  This module attempts to fill that gap.

# Installation

To install this extension, in IPython you can run

    %install_ext https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moble/remote_exec/master/remote_exec.py

This will download that file to somewhere like `~/.ipython/extensions/` on your
computer, where IPython will be able to find it.  You will also get a warning
that `install_ext` is deprecated, but IPython has not yet settled on a useful
way to do this in the future, so we'll have to live with it.

Now you have to load it into your IPython session.  If you just want to try out
the extension, you can load it just once by running

    %load_ext remote_exec

in your IPython session.  To load the extension automatically every time you
run IPython, add something like the following to your `ipython_config.py` file:

    c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions = ['remote_exec',]

You can find this file's directory by doing `ipython profile locate` on the
command line.


# Use

To run, make a cell something like the following:

    %%remote_exec -k kernel1,kernel2 -o x,y
    import numpy as np
    x = np.linspace(0,6)
    y = np.sin(x)

Here, `kernel1,kernel2` lists some kernels that ipython knows how to run, and
are the names of variables exported to the local namespace of the notebook
where this is called.  Each of these `kernelN` variables will contain members
`x` and `y` in this example, which will be the data as computed by those
kernels.  Now, in another cell, we can plot the results as

    plt.plot(kernel1.x, kernel1.y, label='kernel1')
    plt.plot(kernel2.x, kernel2.y+0.1, label='kernel2')
    plt.legend()

Of course, this example is fairly silly because the same thing is done on each
kernel, and could have been done just as easily on the local kernel.  More
interesting examples will use files that are only present on the remote
systems, but are too big to transfer.  Because of this, it is possible to
specify the working directory for each system, as in something like this:

    %%remote_exec -k kernel1:/path/on/system1,kernel2:/different/path -o x,y
    ...

It is also possible to specify slightly different code for different kernels.
In this case, you need to create a dictionary mapping the kernel names to a
string containing the desired code.  For example, you might want to analyze
different filenames on different systems.  You first define the dictionary

    filenames = {'kernel1': '"file1.txt"', 'kernel2': '"file2.txt"'}

Now, you can run code that will substitute those input values at the
appropriate times:

    %%remote_exec -k kernel1:/path/on/system1,kernel2:/different/path -o x,y -i filenames
    import numpy as np
    x, y = np.loadtxt({filenames})

More input variables can be listed separated by commas.  Just remember that the
variable name must be surrounded by braces to be substituted, and that the
substitution will be exact, which is why we included the quotes in the
substitutions, as in `'"file1.txt"'`.  Of course, we could have also included
the quotes in the actual code, and left them out of the substitutions.

Note that the names `kernel1` and `kernel2` need only match a subset of your
kernel's full name, so that `kernel1` could start a kernel that is actually
named `python_kernel1_myserver`.  The only stipulation is that the name you
provide must match exactly one full kernel name, which may not be what is
displayed in the Jupyter notebook's list of kernels.  To find the possible full
kernel names, run `jupyter-kernelspec list` from the command line.  Also note
that the kernels are persistent within your local IPython session, which means
that the same kernels can be used in different cells, so that you can reuse
data or imports or whatever.  The remote kernels are all killed whenever your
main IPython kernel exits.

Finally, it is also possible to use this as a line magic, by putting the code
at the end of the line -- though this is presumably only useful for initial
imports or something comparable:

    %remote_exec -k kernel1,kernel2 import sys, numpy, scri

However, note that in all cases, `pickle` and `os` are imported automatically
because they are necessary for transporting the output variables back to your
local kernel.
